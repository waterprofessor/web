## Research
### Water and Wastewater Engineering
With 20+ years of training and practical experience on experimental chemistry and web-lab explorations of enhanced or noval processes for water and wastewater treatment, Prof. Tang has developed research interests and publication records in the following fields of water and wastewater engineering: 

- Physicochemical procsses with emphases on water desalination and disinfection byproducts control
- Innovative applications of sustainable environmental processes to address challenging issues (shale gas produced water, acid mine drainage, swimming pool water, rainfall and runoff, etc.) for public health protection and industry stewardship
- Intelligent modeling with machine learning techniques for performance predictions, anomaly detections, material discoveries, and finding interpretations
- Aquarium water engineering for minimization of water footprints and environmental concerns of aquaculture

### Water Resources Engineering
Noticing that many contents in the traditional environmental engineering texts are outdated, Prof. Tang is in the process of writing a lab manual for Water Resources Engineering course. Students will be trained to use Python to analyze data, develop models, and solve problems in the domain of Water Resources Engineering. The lab topics include but are not limited to the following: 

- Develop data-driven models for rainfall-runoff analysis
- Solve pipe flow problems in a network of water distribution system

### Financial Engineering

Be aware of the fact that the algorithmic trading world in general is secretive and that almost everyone who is succussful is naturally reluctant to share their secrets in order to protect their sources of success. From practical point of view, there is no choice but learn and generate your own edge in today's competitive financial and cryptocurrency markets. With the fascinating fields of Python and Machine Learning systematically combined, it is also Prof. Tang's interest to  

- Develop robust algorithmic trading strategies
- Develop an AI investor

His algorithms and strategies will be posted for you to back-test[^1]. Subscribe to the RSS feeds for not missing out important info that may become your edge one day!

## Teaching

Prof. Tang has taught over 20 courses in Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics. A detailed teaching portfolio can be found in the [CV](/web/cv/) page. During the present Spring 2022 semester, he teaches Water Resources Engineering (Lecture and Lab) (ENVE 311), Solid and Hazardous Waste Management (ENVE 471), and Environmental Engineering Design (ENVE 498). His office hours are: *M 7:50-8:50P, T 3:35-4:50P & 7:50-8:50P, W 10:00-11:15A & 4:50-5:20P*. You could make an appointment with him for a virtual meeting on Zoom during these times, click [http://iupvideo.zoom.us/j/9106365162](http://iupvideo.zoom.us/j/9106365162). 

## Group

Prof. Tang always welcomes motivated, curious, and diligent students of different academic backgrounds to join his research group. To date, 11 undergraduate and graduate students who worked in his lab have published papers in scientific journals. They are Alvyn Berg, Ting-An Fang, Ty Stewart, Adil Alsaiari, Stephen Long, Siyu Zhu, Kuan Huang, Yanting Li, Danyang Liu, Qihan Yao, and Leijie Xie. Their backgrounds include chemistry, environmental engineering, sports science, mathematics, and computer science. For those graduates who did not have a publication, they had presented their research at conferences and seminars in podium or poster format for at least once. If you are a prospective student looking for research experience in college, check out Prof. Tang's research and you could become one author of published research papers too!
