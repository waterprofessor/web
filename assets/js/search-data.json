            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

          "content": ". Research . Water and Wastewater Engineering . With 20+ years of training and practical experience on experimental chemistry and web-lab explorations of enhanced or noval processes for water and wastewater treatment, Prof. Tang has developed research interests and publication records in the following fields of water and wastewater engineering: . Physicochemical procsses with emphases on water desalination and disinfection byproducts control | Innovative applications of sustainable environmental processes to address challenging issues (shale gas produced water, acid mine drainage, swimming pool water, rainfall and runoff, etc.) for public health protection and industry stewardship | Intelligent modeling with machine learning techniques for prediction of process performances | Aquarium water engineering for minimization of water footprints and environmental concerns of aquaculture | . Water Resources Engineering . Noticing that many contents in the traditional environmental engineering texts are outdated, Prof. Tang is in the process of writing a lab manual for Water Resources Engineering course. Students will be trained to use Python to analyze data, develop models, and solve problems in the domain of Water Resources Engineering. The lab topics include but are not limited to the following: . Develop models for rainfall-runoff analysis | Solve pipe flow problems in a network of water distribution system | . Finance . Be aware of the fact that the algorithmic trading world in general is secretive and that almost everyone who is succussful is naturally reluctant to share their secrets in order to protect their sources of success. From practical point of view, there is no choice but learn and generate your own edge in today’s competitive financial and cryptocurrency markets. With the fascinating fields of Python and Machine Learning systematically combined, Prof. Tang is striving to: . Develop robust algorithmic trading strategies | Develop an AI investor | . His algorithms and strategies will be posted for you to back-test1. Subscribe to the RSS feeds for not missing out important info that may become your edge one day! . Teaching . Prof. Tang has taught over 20 courses in Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics. A detailed teaching portfolio can be found in the CV page. During the present Fall 2021 semester, he teaches Fluid Mechanics (ENVE 201), Environmental Aquatic chemistry (Lecture and Lab) (ENVE 301), Water and Wastewater Treatment (ENVE 461), and Problems in Chemistry (CHEM 498). His office hours are: M 1:20-1:50pm &amp; 2:40-4:05pm; W 1:20-1:50pm &amp; 2:40-4:05pm; R 1:50-2:30pm; and F 1:20-1:50pm. To join a virtual meeting on Zoom with him during these times, click http://iupvideo.zoom.us/j/9106365162. . Group . Prof. Tang always welcomes motivated, curious, and diligent students of different academic backgrounds to join his research group. To date, 11 undergraduate and graduate students who worked in his lab have published papers in scientific journals. They are Alvyn Berg, Ting-An Fang, Ty Stewart, Adil Alsaiari, Stephen Long, Siyu Zhu, Kuan Huang, Yanting Li, Danyang Liu, Qihan Yao, and Leijie Xie. Their backgrounds include chemistry, environmental engineering, sports science, mathematics, and computer science. For those graduates who did not have a publication, they had presented their research at conferences and seminars in podium or poster format for at least once. If you are a prospective student looking for research experience in college, check out Prof. Tang’s research and you could become one author of published research papers too! . More Info .
