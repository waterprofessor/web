Serve as a culminating capstone design experience for environmental engineering seniors. Involves individualized engineering projects with frequent student-instructor interactions. Students learn to use various design concepts and apply the advanced level mathematics, science, and engineering skills learnt from other courses to solve real-world engineering problems. Students should complete and successfully defend their design reports. Completion of this course will prepare environmental engineering seniors for fulfillment of program objectives. . Learning Objectives . Students will learn and demonstrate the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, microbiology courses, as well as environmental engineering courses in this capstone design course. | Students will learn and demonstrate the ability to design environmental systems (e.g., design a drinking water treatment plant, retrofit a wastewater treatment plant, etc.) which meet the design criteria and regulations. | Students will learn the ability to function in a multidiscplinary team through the design project. | Students will learn and demonstrate the ability to identify, formulate, and solve problems related to water quality and treatment, water resources and hydraulics, waste handling and disposal, hazardous waste and environmental safety through the capstone design project. | The course will provide students with an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility through the design project. | Students will learn and demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively through team work, report writing, and project oral presentation. Students are required to provide written reports for their design projects and they are also required to orally defend their project designs. | Students will learn the ability to recognize the need for, and the ability to engage in life-long learning through their design projects. | Students will learn knowledge of contemporary issues in the environmental engineering field (e.g., nutrient problems in Chesapeake Bay, membrane processes and UV disinfection, current and future regulations, design criteria, etc.) | Students will learn the ability to use the various treatment techniques, computer technologies, and other modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. | Prerequisite . Senior standing (90 or more credits) or instructor permission . Recommended Preparation . Students must be enrolled in the B.S. Environmental Engineering Program and have an approved environmental engineering project proposal, with topics assigned by a faculty member or an external advisor - a professional engineer from an industrial affiliate of the Program. . Course Notes . The preparation and defense of project design report is the culminating experience in the B.S. Environmental Engineering Program. Students are expected to work with a high level of self-motivation. Successful students exercise initiative and exhibit strong communication skills in working with the course instructor. The course requires individual effort that is overseen by the course instructor. Weekly or bi-weekly meetings will be held with the course instructor to discuss progress and review submitted documents. Once the necessary analysis and design calculations are completed, then the individual sections will be written and revised iteratively until the course instructor agrees that the document is ready for defense. . Technological and Communication Requirements . Each student must have the following technology requirements: . A personal computer with educational version AutoCAD installed | Microsoft office suite programs are optional, as many other editors such as Google Docs/Sheets, Overleaf (for LaTex editing), etc. in the cloud are available and free. | A virtual private network (VPN) connection to the IUP’s network for accessing library resources while physically not on the campus | A coding environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.) for engineering computing, plotting and conducting statistical analysis if needed | A quiet meeting room if an online presentation or meeting is scheduled | The library computers and the computers in 144 Weyandt (Computational Chemistry Lab) are available in case students need those for specific software programs. | . D2L . While each student must complete his or her work independently, the D2L site is available for obtaining general guidance and resources. It is also a place where students must submit their weekly minute papers, drafts of captone design sections, and the final design report by the due dates for the course instructor to review. . Required Readings and Supplementary Materials . Students need to refer to the textbooks that were required by other ENVE core courses. Supplementary materials are project-specific and will be given by your project advisor. . Description and Assessment of Assignments . The course instructor has developed a work schedule with specific deliverables for each phase. The due dates of the phases are outlined in the “Tentative Schedule” section. Weekly meetings are to discuss student submittals. . Grading Breakdown . Percent Grading Items . 16% | Weekly Minute Papers ($ times$8, 2% each) | . 30% | Capstone Design Project Sections - First Drafts ($ times$3, 10% each) | . 40% | Capstone Design Project - Final Report | . 14% | Design Report Defense | . 100% |   | . Letter grades will be given based on the weighted average specified above and assigned as follows: A $ ge$ 90%, B 80-89%, C 70-79%, D 60-69%, F&lt;60%, and N (Refer to IUP N grade policy). . To satisfy the requirements of a writing-intensive course, written assignments are the major part of the final grade (86%). Each weekly minute paper should be 1 page long, updating the course instructor the progress on the project. There are 8 weekly minute paper submissions through this semester. The weekly minute paper will be graded by the amount of quality of work that is done during that week, and it does not require revisions. However, the individual sections of the capstone design project need to be revised iteratively until the course instructor agrees that the document is ready for defense. Each section (minimum 8 pages long) submitted during the semester is graded based on the quality of the first draft. The final design report is graded based on the overall quality of the work. All students must present their designs at the Environmental Engineering Day that is tentatively scheduled on Wednesday April 27. . Meeting Hours . Monday 5:00-7:50 pm (149 Weyandt) Group and/or individual meetings are held during this time and in this classroom. Each individual meeting typically takes around 30 minutes. You need to discuss with the course instructor about your allocated time. You must attend the meetings to avoid significant point loss. . Course Instructor . H.

Attendance . The University uses the class method of teaching, which assumes that each student has something to contribute and something to gain by attending class. It further assumes that there is much more instruction absorbed in the classroom than can be tested on exams. Therefore, students are expected to attend all regularly scheduled class meetings and should exhibit good faith in this regard. For the control of absences, the instructor adopts the following regulations: . 3 absences may result in an automatic failure in the course. | 2 tardy arrivals may be counted as one absence. | . Homework . There will be a homework assigment after each class, due at the beginning of the next class meeting. Penalties for homework handed in late are: . One day or less: 30% off | 2-3 days: 50% off | $ gt$ 3days: no credit | . Exams . For the two in-class exams, a single sheet of paper may be brougt to the exam with any equations, information, worked problems, etc. the student feels useful. The paper may be typed or handwritten, and both sides may be used. No make-up exams will be given except documented illness or conflicted schedule and by prior arrangement with the instructor, at least, one week before the scheduled exam time. . Exam #3 is a take-home exam. It allows no discussion with your peers. . Grade Policy . For any graded assignment, if you do not agree with the grade received, the instructor must be notified within one week after the assignment is graded. Any request made more than one week after the grading dated will not be considered, no matter whose oversight. . Academic Integrity .

Each homework is due at the beginning of the next class meeting. Penalties for homework handed in late are: . One day or less: 30% off | 2 to 3 days: 50% off | More than 3 days: no credit | . Exam #1 (25%) . A single sheet of paper may be brought to the exam with any equations, information, worked problems, etc. you feel useful. The paper may be typed or handwritten, and both sides may be used. No make-up exams will be given except documented illness or conflicted schedule and by prior arrangement with the instructor, at least, one week before the scheduled exam time. . Exam #2 (15%) . Exam #2 is a take-home exam. It allows no discussion with your peers. . Grade Policy . For any graded assignment, if you do not agree with the grade received, the instructor must be notified within one week after the assignment is graded. Any request made more than one week after the grading dated will not be considered, no matter whose oversight. . Laboratory (40%) . The laboratory topics are concerned with quantitative methods for analyzing large-scale water resource problems. Topics include the design and management of facilities for river basin development, flood control, water supply, groundwater remediation, and other activities related to water resources. Simulation models and optimization methods are often used to support analyses of water resource problems. In this course we will be constructing simulation models with the Python programming language and solving numerical optimization problems with a number of packages including NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SymPy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn. It is desirable for students taking this subject to have some background in calculus (MATH 125), linear algebra (MATH 171), statistics (MATH 216/217), and programming (COSC 110), although these are not strict prerequisites. . In-lab Problem Assignments (13%) . Attendance of laboratory is mandatory. Two absences automatically result in zero for the whole lab section. Problems given during each lab must be completed by the end of each lab. . Individualized Project (27%) . In addition to completing the common lab projects during regular lab hours, each student is required to complete an individualized project of his/her interest. The project has four deliverables: . Proposal (Due 3/9, 3%) Your proposal should be a PDF document, giving the title of the project and a 300-500 word description of what you plan to do. Your project proposal should include the following information: Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result? | Method: What techniques/algorithms are you planning to apply or improve upon? | Intended experiments: What experiment are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your model? | . Presenting pointers to one relevant dataset and one example of prior research on the topic are a valuable (optional) addition. . | Milestone (Due 3/30, 8%) The milestone will help you make sure you’re on track, and should describe what you’ve accomplished so far, and very briefly say what else you plan to do. You should write it as if it’s an “early draft” of what will turn into your final report. You can write it as if you’re writing the first few pages of your final project report, so that you can re-use most of the milestone text in your final report. Note: Your final report is expected to be on the same topic as your milestone. Your milestone should be at most 3 pages, excluding references. Similar to the proposal, it should include Motivation: What problem are you tackling, and what’s the setting you’re considering? | Method: What techniques/algorithms have you tried and why? | Preliminary experiments: Describe the experiments that you’ve run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you’ve done. | Next steps: Given your preliminary results, what are the next steps that you’re considering? | . | Presentation (Due 4/27, 6%) You are required to present your work in a podium and/or poster format at the Environmental Engineering Day on April 27, 2022. The poster needs to be formatted 36 in wide by 24 in tall. A poster with nice, illustrative figures are preferred over posters with lots of text. | Final Report (Due 4/27, 10%) Final project report needs to be 5 single-space pages long (including appendices and figures). Extra pages are allowed if only containing references. The final report will be judged based on the clarity of the report, the relevance of the project to topics taught in this course, the novelty of the problem, and the technical quality and significance of the work. | You are not restricted to only use the methods taught in class. It is okay for you to use a dataset that is not public, as long as you have the required permission to use it. It is okay if two students end up working on the same project as long as they don’t coordinate to do so, in order to not be biased in the way they tackle the problem. Python is the preferred programming language for the project, but any other language is allowed. . Tentative Class Schedule .
